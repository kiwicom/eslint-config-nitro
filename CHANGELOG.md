# Unreleased

DO NOT RELEASE NEW VERSIONS, this package is deprecated

# 4.1.0

- **This package is now deprecated**. Use `@kiwicom/eslint-config/nitro` located in [@kiwicom/eslint-config](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kiwicom/eslint-config) package instead. We do this in order to unify these configs. There should be no breaking changes - just a simple switch to a new name (available from version 8.1.0).

# 4.0.0

- Plugin `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` upgraded to the latest version. This is a breaking change, see: https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/16455
- Upgraded `eslint-config-airbnb` dependency to the latest version. This is a breaking change, see: https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/blob/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb/CHANGELOG.md#1800--2019-08-10 (the actual changes are [captured here](https://github.com/kiwicom/eslint-config-kiwicom/commit/bba21d7f50497529933510c4b385f12420e77c5a#diff-83e65654704ff52d4fa224e5e7ecc300))
